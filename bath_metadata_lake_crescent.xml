      <abstract>In February 2016 the U.S. Geological Survey, Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in cooperation with North Carolina State University and the National Park Service collected multibeam bathymetry and acoustic-backscatter data in Lake Crescent located in Olympic National Park, Washington. Data were collected using a Reson 7111 multibeam echosounder pole-mounted to the 36-foot USGS R/V Parke Snavely. These metadata describe the multibeam bathymetry raster data file that is included in "LakeCrescent_bathy_3m_UTM10_NAD83_NAVD88.zip" which is accessible from https://doi.org/10.5066/F7B56GW5.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public. These data can be used with geographic information systems or other software to identify bathymetric features. These data are not intended to be used for navigation.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Additional information about the field activities from which these data were derived are available online at

        <procdesc>Between February 8 and 11, 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey collected multibeam bathymetry and acoustic backscatter data in Lake Crescent, Washington using a Reson 7111 multibeam echosounder mounted on the R/V Parke Snavely. During the mapping mission an Applanix POS MV (Position and Orientation System for Marine Vessels) was used to accurately position the vessel during data collection and it also accounted for vessel motion such as heave, pitch, and roll. The POS MV also recorded position and vessel motion parameters for later post-processing. Sound-velocity profiles were collected throughout the survey days with an Applied Microsystems (AM) SVPlus sound velocimeter. The multibeam s7k files were imported into Caris HIPS and SIPS software and merged with post-processed POS MV Smoothed Best Estimate of Trajectory (SBET) files as well as the sound-velocity profiles. Soundings were cleaned for obvious errors and gridded into a 3-m base surface. The base surface was exported as an ASCIIRaster file in UTM-10 coordinates referenced to the WGS84 ellipsoid and imported into a GIS. Further grid cleaning of artifacts was completed in the GIS. From Geoid12B website http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOID/GEOID12B/ there is a 20.227m offset between the WGS84 ellipsoid and NAVD88 elevations at 48 degrees, 3.509', 123 degrees 49.875' location (center of survey area). The value of 20.227 was added to the bathymetry grid to reference the grid to NAVD88 elevations. The grid was then projected from WGS84 to NAD83 using the WGS84_1984_(ITRF08)_to_NAD_1983_2011 tool in ESRI ArcTools. The grid was then exported to an ASCIIRaster file in UTM-10, NAD83 coordinates referenced to NAVD88 elevations.</procdesc>
