Morrigan Havely's project code!

Summary: I processed two zip files, one with asc data (bathymetry data) and the other with a tif file (acoustic backscatter data), and placed those in JupyterHub as Numpy Arrays. I converted my bathymetry data into xarray and plotted it using a contourf plot with overlaying contour lines, and I processed my acoustic backscatter as a contourf plot as well. Finally, I overlayed the bathymetry contour plot lines onto the acoustic backscatter contourf plot to get my final graph.

Notes:
<br>
* Even though I'm linking the data here, I chose not to link the data in my Jupyter Notebook because I did not learn until three days before the presentation was due that GitHub is too small for my data and JupyterHub isn't.
* Also, "project_code_full" is the JupyterHub notebook with my failed graphs' code and "project_code_cleaned" has that code taken out.
